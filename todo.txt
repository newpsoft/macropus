Headless mode loads only one file, may prompt for password.

Offer option to exit when load file fails?
Array-based modes? Needs in-memory macro mode list to be reference to mode object. Saved file mode list is still a list of strings.
  look at: MacroList, Layout, MacroSettings, MainWindow, ModeList, ModeTabs, RunMacros, SelectorWindow, LibmacroSettings?
  checked: EditMacros, Globals
Data model for macro list?
Make recorder context-sensitive.  Any list recorder should not interfere with user actions.  May be purposeful user actions.  Main window should not accept input while recording.
Flag-enumerations in-memory as integer, save as array of named enumeration
  settings option to save as integer or array of names
If applyMacrosInMode and remove macro from list, remove macro from applied.
EditStack in Globals and push is wonky. Maybe do a signal to push with component and container parameters.
showbackbutton and window title depends on visiblePage variable. No current solution.
Style settings: Add load from file, remove text edit boxes, and add color selector.
Change macro recorder options to floating button or something that can be accessed with editing or running macros.

launch option: Add option for external main qml file to load (with the benefits of our libraries).

WorkerScript and loading circle when applying macros, load/save file

Macro algorithm:
 Fix concurrency and reduce usage of mutices.

macro list view:
 ScrollView for Mode tabs.

Hotkey window - a hotkey will be an Action trigger and Key activator
 Use case: simplification.  Restrict to one set of modifiers and only key presses.
 1) Wait for key up.  After 3 seconds assume "no modifiers" (instead have button or option for no modifiers).
 2) On key up record Action of all current modifiers.
 3) Wait for a key down or up.
 4) Keep listening for key presses until pause.
 5) After pause, record activators.
   5.a) One key only, max of one down and one up, record only key down as the activator.
   5.b) Multiple keys, convert Action to Staged with set of keys.  All stages have the same modifiers.

Macro recorder
 Add time intervals
 Setting for recorded time interval, constant time interval, or no recorded intervals.

Libmacro
 Move name => integer maps from C to C++ std::map
 Reduce (void *) function arguments, non-typed arguments cause problems.
 Optional message loop with condition variable to replace threading.
 Common header for "__cplusplus is required" error.
